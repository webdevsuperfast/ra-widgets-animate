== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to install SiteOrigin Panels to be able to use the animation? =

No, the fields will attached itself to existing widgets on 'Widgets' screen in WordPress. If you have SiteOrigin Panels installed, the 'Animation' tab will be added to SiteOrigin Panels 'Widget Styles'.

= How can I set Animate on Scroll settings globally without having to edit each widgets?

You can set the global settings through `Settings > RA Widgets Animate > Global Settings`.

= I have Animate on Scroll already, how can I disable the AOS script on your plugin to prevent conflict?

You can disable Animate on Scroll scripts and styles through `Settings > RA Widgets Animate > Script Settings`.

= I want to add additional animation values, how can I do that?

As of version `1.1.7`, you can now add custom animation values using the built-in `rawa_animations` filter. Add the following code in your functions.php file.

`<?php
add_filter( 'rawa_animations', function( $animation ) {
    new_animation = array(
        'custom-animation' => __( 'Custom Animation' ),
    );

    return array_merge( $animation, $new_animation );
} );`

Then, add the following to your css file:

`[data-aos="custom-animation"] {
    transform: skewX(45deg);
    opacity: 0;
    transition-property: transform, opacity;
}
[data-aos="custom-animation"].aos-animate {
    transform: skewX(0);
    opacity: 1;
}`
